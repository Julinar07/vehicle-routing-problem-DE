Vehicle Routing Problem Using Differential Evolution Algorithm Study Case PT Surabaya Industrial Estate Rungkut (PT SIER)

Hello everyone, this is one of my project with my friends from Industrial Engineering department from Universitas Pembangunan Nasional "Veteran" Jawa Timur. I use MATLAB programming language to solve the formula that we are created.

Here we create a mathematical formula to optimize the logistic distribution problem. We solved the formula by using Differential Evolution (DE) optimization algorithm. We compare the results of the formula solution in the form of PT SIER's logistics truck route flow with the original truck route data. Here we find the results that using the formula and DE algorithm that we propose able to shorten the distance and travel time of the trucks, thus optimizing operational costs.

But, in this repository, I just give you the MATLAB code, not the research document. Maybe I will give you the link of the journal later.
